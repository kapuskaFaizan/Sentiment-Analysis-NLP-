# Sentiment-Analysis-NLP
Sentiment analysis is the automated process that uses AI to identify positive, negative and neutral opinions from text.
Sentiment analysis is widely used for getting insights from social media comments, survey responses, and product reviews, 
and making data-driven decisions.

# K-NN
KNN (K — Nearest Neighbors) is one of many (supervised learning) algorithms used in data mining and machine learning, it’s
a classifier algorithm where the learning is based “how similar” is a data (a vector) from other.It is widely disposable in real-life scenarios since it is non-parametric, meaning, it does not make any underlying assumptions about the distribution 
of data (as opposed to other algorithms such as GMM, which assume a Gaussian distribution of the given data). 

# Random Forest
Random forest algorithm is a supervised classification algorithm. As the name suggest, this algorithm creates the forest with
a number of trees.In general, the more trees in the forest the more robust the forest looks like. In the same way in the random forest classifier, the higher the number of trees in the forest gives the high accuracy results.
If you know the decision tree algorithm. You might be thinking are we creating more number of decision trees and how can we create more number of decision trees. As all the calculation of nodes selection will be same for the same dataset.

# Decision Tree
A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is one way to display an algorithm that only contains conditional control statements.
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a “test” on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules.

# Convolutional neural network(CNN)
A convolutional neural network has an input layer, an output layer and various hidden layers. Some of these layers are convolutional, using a mathematical model to pass on results to successive layers. This simulates some of the actions in the human visual cortex.CNNs are a fundamental example of deep learning, where a more sophisticated model pushes the evolution of artificial intelligence by offering systems that simulate different types of biological human brain activity. These are mostly used for image recognition or classification but prove to be quiet efficient for text classification as well.
